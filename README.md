## Project goals

- Get more practice in OOP
- Design patterns: layer separation (All of the game logic, i.e., player
  movement, game rules, and so on), is in the `logic` package, completely
  independent of user interface code. In principle, you could implement a
  completely different interface e.g. terminal, web, Virtual Reality, etc. for
  the same logic code.)

## Technologies

- C#
- :open_book: [Perlin 2D engine](https://github.com/matyasf/Perlin) You dont need to dwelve into this, most of the GUI is ready.

## References
